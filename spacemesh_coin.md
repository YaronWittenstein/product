Add an explainer about Spacemesh coin here.

# Basic Units
- `Spacemesh Cent(LERNER)` - the basic unit of accounting for the native coin. Used mostly by developers in the code.
- `Spacemesh Coin (SMC)`. 1 Spacemesh Coin equals 10^18 Spacemesh cents. Used for validation awards and as the name of the native coin of the Spacemesh mainnet.

# Additional Units
- `Killocents (KCents)(GAVRAD)`. 1 Killocents equals to 10^3 Spacemesh cents
- `Megacents (MCents)(YOSHER)`. 1 Megacents equals to 10^6 Spacemesh cents
- `Gigacents (GCents)(ALMOG)`. 1 Gigacents equals to 10^9 Spacemesh cents

# Reasoning
- We'd like to keep the units simple and to a minimum
- We should not require users to understand more than 2 units - cents and coins unless there's a very compelling reason to have more units.
- We welcome community suggestions for better and cooler cents and coins names
