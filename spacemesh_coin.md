# Spacemesh Coin Units (Spacemesh 0.x - Testnet timeframe)

## Basic Units
- `Spacemesh Coin` (SMC / Shmekel). One Spacemesh Coin equals to 10^18 Spacemesh cents. Used for validation awards and as the name of the native coin of the Spacemesh Testnet.
- `Spacemesh Silver` (SMS). 1,000 Spacemesh Silvers equal to one Spacemesh Coin.
- `Spacemesh Cent` (Lerner). The basic unit of accounting for the native coin. Used mostly by developers in the code.

## Additional Units
- `Killocent` (KCent)(Gavrad)`. 1 Killocent equals to 10^3 Spacemesh cents
- `Megacent` (MCent)(Yosher)`. 1 Megacent equals to 10^6 Spacemesh cents
- `Gigacent` (GCent)(Almog)`. 1 Gigacent equals to 10^9 Spacemesh cents

## Rational
- We'd like to keep the units simple and to a minimum
- We should not require users to understand more than 2 units - cents and coins unless there's a very compelling reason to have more units.
- We welcome community suggestions for better and cooler cents and coins names
