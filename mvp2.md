# Release Highlights

- Bug fixes, security fixes and optimizations for mainnet
- Smart contracts - toolchain, dev workflow, execution and wallet integration
- Adjusted params for mainnet
- Improved wallet and Spacemesh App

## Use Cases
1. Write a smart contract in one of the supported programming languages. e.g. `Rust` or `Typescript`
2. Deploy a smart contract to testnet
3. Call a smart contract method from the Spacemesh Wallet or using the `Spacemesh API` and the `Spacemesh Gateway`. This requires adding support for smart contract transactions in the full node.
4. Get smart contract state from a client such as the `Spacemesh Wallet` using the `Spacemesh Gateway` and the 'Spacemesh API'
5. Write and run smart contract tests on a testnet
6. Deploy a smart contract to mainnet
