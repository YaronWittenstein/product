## Overview

Our short-term high-level product plan is to build [MVP1](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/wiki/MVP1) and [MVP2](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/wiki/MVP2) and release testnets and mainnets for this products according to the project [roadmap](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/wiki/Roadmap).

Our longer-term high-level product plan is to implement, test and roll-out additional capabilities and features to the platform in subsequent incremental releases until the full platform is released as `Spacemesh 1.0`.

## Spacemesh 0.1 (MVP1)

The main use case case of MVP1 is to support [Spacemesh Coin]() cryptocurrency transactions between anyone and to award Spacemesh coins to validators who run full Spacemesh nodes on the Spacemesh mainent. The full node implements the Spacemesh consensus protocol and other protocols to support this use case.

The main goal of this release is to provide a basic working version of a permissionless and trustless Internet money that is secure, decentralized and scalable without using POW or PoStake.

### Release main software components

1. [Spacemesh full p2p node](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh)
2. [Spacemesh POET service](https://github.com/spacemeshos/POET)
3. [Spacemesh App](https://github.com/spacemeshos/app) - Wallet and Dashboard
4. `Spacemesh Gateway` - Foundation nodes providing the `Spacemesh API` over https-json
5. [Spacemesh API](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/wiki/spacemesh-api) - The common API provided by gateways and full nodes
6. [Spacemesh Tap](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/wiki/tap) - get `Spacemesh Coins` on testnets

## Release 0.2 (MVP2)

The main goal of this release is to add smart contracts capabilities to the Spacemesh platforms.

The main new feature of MVP2 is [smart contracts](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/wiki/Smart-Contracts) support.

In additional to MVP1 functionality, MVP2 enables developers to code, test, deploy and update smart contracts on the Spacemesh global computer and for users to interact with smart contracts using smart contract transactions.

We'd like to build a modern wasm-based VM with `Rust` or `Typescript` as the main smart contracts supported programming languages.

### Release features and components
1. Spacemesh smart contracts dev tools
2. `Spacemesh full node`, `Spacemesh API` and `Spacemesh Gateway` updates to support smart contract transactions and reading programs state

### Use cases
- [Available here](mvp2.md)

## Release 0.3

### Main new features
- `Payment channels` - many-to-many micro transactions support
- The `Spacemesh SDK` - an SDK for building Spacemesh apps

### Release new components
- `Spacemesh full node`, `Spacemesh API` and `Spacemesh Gateway` updates to support payment channels
- `Spacemesh SDK` - A Javascript npm library for node.js server apps and client-side web apps

### Use cases
1. Add `Spacemesh Coins` or token payments features your app.

This use case will be implemented using the `Spacemesh SDK` and a 'Spacemesh API Provider' such as the `Spacemesh Browser Extension` for web apps.

## Release 1.0

### Release features and components
- Generalized state channels - offload app state from the blockmesh
- `Spacemesh full node`, `Spacemesh API` and `Spacemesh Gateway`, `Spacemesh SDK` updates to support state channels
