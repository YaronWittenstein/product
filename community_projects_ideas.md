## Bitly-style short codes for users public key exchange

### Motivation
Long hex keys are user-unfriendly but they need to share them with others users in order to get paid.
It is much nicer to share very short codes. We know from web2.0 that users love short urls and hate long and complicated urls.
The idea here is to generate unique short codes for every account on-chain publix address, e.g. Ax3ba instead of thier raw long public keys and to add support in wallets for this format. On-chain is needed to avoid having to use a single-trusted party for short name to full addresses resolution. So, in this scheme the immutable short urls will be part of the canonical account state.
