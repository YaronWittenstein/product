## Bitly-style short codes for users public key exchange

### Motivation
Long hex keys are user-unfriendly but they need to share them with others users in order to get paid.
It is much nicer to share very short codes. We know from web2.0 that users love short urls and hate long and complicated urls.
The idea here is to enable users to generate and share very short codes, e.g. Ax3ba instead of thier raw long public keys.
