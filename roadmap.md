## Q4 2017
- Go-spacemesh App scaffolding
- Core p2p protocol
- Core data structures
- Initial project specs
- Support for accounts
- Node gRPC and json-httop API

## Q1 2018
- Core p2p and node capabilities

## Milestone 1 - `Catch a Fire` - Q2 2018
- Published [White Paper 1](https://spacemesh.io/whitepaper1/) with initial protocols tech specs 

## Milestone 2 - `Nice & Smooth` - Q4 2018
- Publish *White Paper 2* with full protocols specs and security proofs

## Milestone 3 - `Rings of Saturn` - Q2 2019
- MVP1 code-complete and testnet
- Packaged node software for all major platforms running on testnet

## Milestone 4 - `Giant Steps` - Q3 2019
- MVP2 - code complete and testing on testnet
- MVP1 mainnet launch - Spacemesh coin cryptocurrency 

## Milestone 5 - `The Immortal` - Q4 2019
- MVP2 mainnet deployment
- Integrated state channels, private transactions, and programability dev focus

*Caveat*: we are only going to launch a mainnet supporting the Spacemesh Coin cryptocurrency once we have obtained a high-degree of confidence in the security of our platform. This means both full published theoretical proofs for all of the protocols and the security of the Spacemesh node implementation.
