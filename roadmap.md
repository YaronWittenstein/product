## Milestone 4 - Spacemesh 0.1 Testnet Soft Launch - Q4 2019

## Milestone 5 - Spacemesh 0.2 Testnet Updates - Q1 2020

- [ ] Support adjustable POST commitment sizes per node.

## Milestone 6 - Spacemesh 0.3 - Q3 2020
- [ ] Implement all protocol updates.
- [ ] Smart contracts preview with smart wallets.
- [ ] Security audit and bug bounties program.
- [ ] Fix all critical issues found in audit.

## Milestone 7 - Spacemesh 0.3.x Mainnet - Q3/Q4 2020

*Caveat*: we are only going to launch a Mainnet supporting the Spacemesh Coin cryptocurrency once we have obtained a high-degree of confidence in the security of our platform. This means both full published theoretical proofs for all of the protocols and the security of the Spacemesh node implementation.
