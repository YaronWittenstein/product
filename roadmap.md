## Milestone 4 - Spacemesh 0.1 Testnet Release - Q4 2019

## Milestone 5 - Spacemesh 0.x Testnet Updates - 2020
- [ ] Spacemesh 0.x - major updates for Testnet with smart contracts infrastructure and improvements to other features over a period of 10 months
- [ ] Launch Explorer, Dashboard and Tap
- [ ] Support wallet-only mode
- [ ] Build and run full node from source (go-spacemesh + CLI wallet) instead of using the App

## Milestone 6 - Spacemesh 0.x Mainnet - Q3/Q4 2020

*Caveat*: we are only going to launch a Mainnet supporting the Spacemesh Coin cryptocurrency once we have obtained a high-degree of confidence in the security of our platform. This means both full published theoretical proofs for all of the protocols and the security of the Spacemesh node implementation
